# Discord Bot Project
Discord bot written using Python and nextcord library

 ## About the project
 This is a fun project made/currently in progress to use in my and my friend Discord channels
 The bot imitates umamusume character (Not really, but commands and some names are umamusume themed)
 I am also practicing my python usage with it.

 ## How to install
 If you want to install the project you will need to download this repository as well as create your own
 discord bot token and server token (server token is needed for updating commands locally). Also remember to
 download nextcord and other python libraries that might be needed for running it, **note that output of some commands
 might be not safe for work**, because bot doesnt have a filtering functionality yet.

 ## Commands
| Command         | description                                                              | picture |
